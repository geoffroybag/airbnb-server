Kitty teaches Universal White Time Gemstone Healing, is a healer, artist, builder, farmer and musician. Michael works at the University of California, Santa Cruz Extension in Silicon Valley, managing the International Education program. He bikes, runs, swims, sometimes all in the same day. Together, Kitty and Michael teach Meditation classes with the "Teaching of Intuitional Metaphysics" under the guidance of the Masters Babaji, Jesus, and St. Germain. The young adults here are photographers, surfers, artists and/or musicians and budding farmers. We are slowly turning this land into a permaculture farm and a center of creativity, learning to live simply, with joy and kindness. We hold a public non-denominational meditation at our house every Sunday night: you are welcome to join us if you are here. We have been hosting on airbnb since July, 2009 and really love what this company has made possible. We have met so many wonderful people from around the world that we would never have met if we hadn't had this opportunity with airbnb! Some of our guests (especially the ones from Europe) have never seen a hummingbird before and here they get to see them up close - just a few feet from them as the birds "hum" around the feeders. We welcome you to come experience the peace and tranquility that our wonderful land has to offer.`,

    host_about: `I know your not coming to Nashville to visit me, but i will do my best to provide a great place to stay while you are in Nashville! I am a single Dad with 2 great kids off to college! I built this home 3 years ago and love living near downtown Nashville. I am an avid walker and most weeks put in 15 to 20 miles just walking from my home to the Historical Germantown area, Bicentennial Mall State Park, Farmers Market, State Capital, Legislative Plaza, TPAC, then on to Lower Broad, 2nd Ave, and Riverfront park where all the honky tonks are located! That total distance is just a little over 2 miles each way. I was in the USAF and Tennessee Air Guard for 13 years where i was a navigator on C-130's. After my military life i became a General Contractor and started my own business. After being in the country for so long i decided to try the city life. I bought a vacant lot in this historical overlay district and loved it. Since then I have built 2 more homes on this street. I do love this up and coming neighborhood. I also love to hike the mountains! I have summed 3 12,000 foot peaks in the Rockies and last summer my son and I summed 14,254 foot Long's Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park. I must admit - it kicked my ass ... but wow!... what a view! Leaves no doubt there is a God! I also love to kayak and travel. But the best times are with the kids. We love to play strategy board games..Settlers of Catan, Acquire, and Cashflow. I love Axis and Allies, but its hard to get them to play that! I also play in a Texas holdem Poker League...for points...not for cash! UPDATE: That's my first grandbaby...Walt....Born 19 November 2012!!`,

You retire to the comfortable semi-restored interior of 'THE ALUMILODGE'- a 1957 AIRSTREAM 22 ft.

    host_about: `My wife and I are Christian, semi-retired film industry people who thrive on adventure and meeting interesting people. Over the past 15 years I've restored several vintage Airstream trailers and consider them the ultimate in camping comfort. One of my restorations now actually resides in Japan! We used to love to travel and camp in our 1957 'FLYING CLOUD' AIRSTREAM but now enjoy allowing others to share the experience without the hassle of driving, towing and fighting for a spot in a crowded and noisy campground. We live on a 40+ acre ranch property (with some overly friendly dogs and horses) in the Santa Monica Mountains- surrounded by thousands of acres of open space and direct access to the famous Backbone Trail, which is renowned for hiking, horseback and mountain bike riding. We are also only 6 miles from the glorious beaches of Malibu. Our hilltop location is the perfect deluxe camping experience, with ocean views, and base to enjoy this unique mountain range and Mediterranean climate which occurs in only 6 places in the world.`,

    host_about: `I know your not coming to Nashville to visit me, but i will do my best to provide a great place to stay while you are in Nashville! I am a single Dad with 2 great kids off to college! I built this home 3 years ago and love living near downtown Nashville. I am an avid walker and most weeks put in 15 to 20 miles just walking from my home to the Historical Germantown area, Bicentennial Mall State Park, Farmers Market, State Capital, Legislative Plaza, TPAC, then on to Lower Broad, 2nd Ave, and Riverfront park where all the honky tonks are located! That total distance is just a little over 2 miles each way. I was in the USAF and Tennessee Air Guard for 13 years where i was a navigator on C-130's. After my military life i became a General Contractor and started my own business. After being in the country for so long i decided to try the city life. I bought a vacant lot in this historical overlay district and loved it. Since then I have built 2 more homes on this street. I do love this up and coming neighborhood. I also love to hike the mountains! I have summed 3 12,000 foot peaks in the Rockies and last summer my son and I summed 14,254 foot Long's Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park. I must admit - it kicked my ass ... but wow!... what a view! Leaves no doubt there is a God! I also love to kayak and travel. But the best times are with the kids. We love to play strategy board games..Settlers of Catan, Acquire, and Cashflow. I love Axis and Allies, but its hard to get them to play that! I also play in a Texas holdem Poker League...for points...not for cash! UPDATE: That's my first grandbaby...Walt....Born 19 November 2012!!`,

Along the way browse Farmers Market, then checkout Bicentennial park, then take the capital steps up to the State capital building(check out the view!), then on to War Memorial Plaza and your downtown! Just a short walk down Church St to the entertainment district, and you have to walk out on the pedestrian bridge over the Cumberland River just for the view of Nashville!! - Take a $6 Lift or Uber ride (Second best choice!!) - Less than 2 mile drive ( but parking will cost you..especially on the busy weekends!)

    host_about: `I know your not coming to Nashville to visit me, but i will do my best to provide a great place to stay while you are in Nashville! I am a single Dad with 2 great kids off to college! I built this home 3 years ago and love living near downtown Nashville. I am an avid walker and most weeks put in 15 to 20 miles just walking from my home to the Historical Germantown area, Bicentennial Mall State Park, Farmers Market, State Capital, Legislative Plaza, TPAC, then on to Lower Broad, 2nd Ave, and Riverfront park where all the honky tonks are located! That total distance is just a little over 2 miles each way. I was in the USAF and Tennessee Air Guard for 13 years where i was a navigator on C-130's. After my military life i became a General Contractor and started my own business. After being in the country for so long i decided to try the city life. I bought a vacant lot in this historical overlay district and loved it. Since then I have built 2 more homes on this street. I do love this up and coming neighborhood. I also love to hike the mountains! I have summed 3 12,000 foot peaks in the Rockies and last summer my son and I summed 14,254 foot Long's Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park. I must admit - it kicked my ass ... but wow!... what a view! Leaves no doubt there is a God! I also love to kayak and travel. But the best times are with the kids. We love to play strategy board games..Settlers of Catan, Acquire, and Cashflow. I love Axis and Allies, but its hard to get them to play that! I also play in a Texas holdem Poker League...for points...not for cash! UPDATE: That's my first grandbaby...Walt....Born 19 November 2012!!`,

Different hosts are handling the collection differently, some by just increasing their prices to cover it, but in order to save you, the guest, money (by not having to pay the Airbnb fee and the Colorado tax on the portion added to cover the Denver lodging tax) I will ask you (in a process I initiate) to remit it through the Airbnb resolutions process within 72 hours of having completed your reservation. The percentage will be figured on the amount of the reservation before Airbnb added their fee.

I'm easy going and easy to get along with. Staying with me can be like staying with a friend of a friend, in that I am glad to try to take care of your needs, and give you pointers about Denver, (or pick you up from the train from the airport - Central Park stop) or also happy to leave you alone and grant you all the privacy you want (tell me.) I have no pets, but occasionally I dog sit for my grandpuppy. I speak French well, some German and Spanish. As a traveler, I love to go places, stay a while, and interact with locals. I love using Airbnb to travel and like to stay with hosts who also live in the property. I enjoy just walking around, getting a feel for a city and meeting people, more than just seeing the big tourist attractions. I think I am adaptable and an easy and appreciative guest. I love to speak French, practice my Spanish and even try to resurrect my long-forgotten German. I always like to try to learn to say at least please and thank you in the language of any place I visit.`,

    host_about: `My wife and I are Christian, semi-retired film industry people who thrive on adventure and meeting interesting people. Over the past 15 years I've restored several vintage Airstream trailers and consider them the ultimate in camping comfort. One of my restorations now actually resides in Japan! We used to love to travel and camp in our 1957 'FLYING CLOUD' AIRSTREAM but now enjoy allowing others to share the experience without the hassle of driving, towing and fighting for a spot in a crowded and noisy campground. We live on a 40+ acre ranch property (with some overly friendly dogs and horses) in the Santa Monica Mountains- surrounded by thousands of acres of open space and direct access to the famous Backbone Trail, which is renowned for hiking, horseback and mountain bike riding. We are also only 6 miles from the glorious beaches of Malibu. Our hilltop location is the perfect deluxe camping experience, with ocean views, and base to enjoy this unique mountain range and Mediterranean climate which occurs in only 6 places in the world.`,

We currently have 3 listings for you to choose from. The first 2 are single private rooms in an art building near the sports stadiums. Dirk has a contemporary art gallery there and Jaq has her painting studio there, so we're usually around. We also have a 1-bedroom apartment in the center of downtown near the Convention Center and popular attractions like the Pike Place Market. We travel and use airbnb just like you, so we understand what it's like to be a guest. As you can see from our many reviews, we'll do our best to make your stay easy & comfortable. If you have any questions just get in touch!`,

You can look the area up if you want more information. It is truly a wonderful area, and its undergoing an amazing renaissance that will bring even more amazing bars and restaurants, housing options, and outdoor spaces to live, work and play. It's one of Nashville's hottest areas in which to live. First Tennessee Park, the home of the AAA MiLB Nashville Sounds, is 4 blocks from my home. Nashville's diverse dining, entertainment, and cultural events at your doorstep, the Germantown/Hope Gardens/Historic Buena Vista neighborhood is the perfect location for guests visiting Nashville. The Germantown area was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 and contains beautifully diverse architecture spanning from the early 1800s to present. This close-knit community features unique events such as the annual Oktoberfest Street Fes`,

Once we get a chance to say hello, I'll take you up to the room, give you the wireless key for your tablet, laptop, or mobile phone. Come and go, as much as you'd like--late or early. You're welcome to hang out with me and my friends if you'd like. I've taken guests to the bar with my buddies. I've tagged along with them. We often go to dinner together. I love getting to know my guests! That's the main reason I host. If you're new to the South, don't be shocked by my kindness. I'm from Alabama and we treat guests like family where I come from. I have developed a 20 minute tour [by car] of the downtown area to highlight key places and areas you might want to visit while on your stay.

    host_about: `I'm a 34 year old bachelor living [the good life] in Nashville, TN. I built my home 9 years ago, just 2 miles from the city center and the incredible live music that made Nashville famous. I've housed over 1300 total Airbnb guests since I began hosting in April 2013. I've also received the designation of Airbnb SuperHost. I know that if you come stay the night or week, you'll have a wonderful time in Nashville, with my home as your home base. I'm happy to make restaurant recommendations and guide you towards transit options, and "must see" sights and sounds. I LOVE taking my guests [that are new to Nashville] out by car to show them the area on a brief, but thorough, 30-minute tour of the downtown area. The goal of the tour is to get you familiar with the many things there are to see and do in Nashville. With that information in hand, I hope you will feel adequately equipped to hit the ground running. Hopefully, you'll learn something you didn't know about our town that would enrich your trip and help make it especially memorable for you. Making your trip special is why I host on Airbnb. That's what makes this experience different than a night at the local chain hotel. My home is 1.5 miles from the Gulch, 2 miles from Broadway bars, two blocks from the Nashville Farmers Market and three blocks from First Tennessee Park, home of the Nashville Sounds baseball team. I'm 3 miles from Vanderbilt, 2 miles from both Nissan Stadium and Ascend Amphitheater, and 1.5 miles from Bridgestone Arena. I'm a $6 uber ride to anything downtown and $8 to Vandy or Centennial Park in the West End of Nashville. I'm well connected to the nightlife and social scene here in town, so i'm also happy to point you to places I go. The invitation always exists for you to hang out with me and my buddies when we head out, for those of you that might be traveling alone or in a pair. Hands down—Airbnb is "the" best new activity i've introduced into to my life in recent years. I've stayed as an Airbnb guest myself, and i've hosted hundreds of people just like you. I can't imagine my life without Airbnb. What an amazing experience! Come join me.`,

Dirk has a contemporary art gallery there and Jaq has her painting studio there, so we're usually around. We also have a 1-bedroom apartment in the center of downtown near the Convention Center and popular attractions like the Pike Place Market. We travel and use airbnb just like you, so we understand what it's like to be a guest. As you can see from our many reviews, we'll do our best to make your stay easy & comfortable.

New Orleans has treated me well and I hope to repay it the favor for many years to come. I have been an airbnb host since July 2012. The property was first listed on airbnb by the previous owner "Belinda." We want to be able to provide all of our guests with a quiet, nice and convenient place to stay as they take in all that New Orleans has to offer. We hope to meet with you soon and help to make your New Orleans experience memorable. Talk soon! Whitney (& Tom) :)`,

I enjoy running and cycling and would like to get back into classic car restoration - previous successful projects have included two Morris Minors, a Rover 2000 and an Austin Healey Frogeye Sprite. My perfect holiday involves a good balance of activity and relaxation and I aim to ensure that every guest at The Mews enjoys their perfect holiday in Edinburgh.

    neighborhood_overview: `The Castro is a vibrant neighborhood with lots of restaurants, coffee shops, and the amazing Castro Theatre. It's also a safe neighborhood. While historically a gay neighborhood, that is changing now. Everyone will feel welcome in the Castro, I can assure you. While homelessness is a problem in SF, you won't see that near the house. It's only when you get to Castro & Market that you'll notice it. The fact that I live on a hill is a deterrent! PARKING IS EASY HERE This is a great choice if you have a car!! While most SF neighborhoods require a parking permit in order to park for any longer than two hours, my neighborhood has NO TIME RESTRICTIONS for parking so you can leave the car for as long as you want. The only caveat is street cleaning which happens on Wed. 12-2 (on odd side of street) and Thurs 9-11 on the even side).`,

    transit: `These days I recommend to my guests that they use Lyft to get around. It's cheap and extremely efficient. You don't have to wait around for more than a few minutes once you order a car. With Lyft Line (picks up other passengers) you can get from place to place for about $5. So worth it! Plus, then you don't have to walk up the hill! If you don't have Lyft on your phone, I can send you a link that will give you a discount. This neighborhood is also very convenient for public transportation. The underground train is a 5 minute walk down the street (Castro Station) that can take you downtown in 10 minutes. Also there are the historic street cars which will take you to the Ferry Building and Fisherman's Wharf. My neighborhood is in the center of SF, making it extremely accessible to other parts of the city.`,

    host_about: `Hello! I've been hosting since 2011 and was recently named a SuperHost. Getting to meet new guests everyday -- and the trust inherent in that process -- brings me a lot of joy. While I'm originally from the east coast, I moved to San Francisco 22 years ago and it's my home now. San Francisco is heaven on earth -- a magical place with a collective spirit of diversity, creativity, and open-mindedness. I'm currently getting a PhD in sociology at UC Davis. My recent research has focused on elites and education, and currently I'm researching women in high tech. I'm also a freelance photographer for a textbook called Seeing Sociology and I write as freelancer as well. I love movies, mostly independent films and documentaries. My favorite films are The Station Agent, American Beauty, and, most recently, Boyhood. My favorite documentary is Baraka. Travel is pretty much in my blood. I sometimes just have to get away to spark creativity. I have driven across country twice. I've been to Cuba, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Indonesia and, most recently, Japan. I love meeting new people and enjoy hearing about people's lives. So I hope we will have a chance to talk while you're here! I love good food too. I do some cooking, but I'm better at knowing where to get good food in the city. I'm a big music fan as well - in fact I have a guitar here you are welcome to play if you know how since I sure haven't been using it lately. I am also up on the best venues to see music in the city if you're interested in that. In terms of my style as a host, I tend to be pretty attuned to my guests' needs. I can usually sense if they need my help with things, in which case I am always happy to provide any guidance. I like to give guests plenty of space to have their own experience here, so you won't find me being overbearing and asking for your time. I'm pretty quiet and spend a lot of time in my room reading or working. But I do love to have chats with the guests to find out where they've been that day and how they liked it, and particularly if they tried any of the recs I provided. The bottom line is I love to have guests in my home. I love hearing about their experiences. And I also respect that they are here to do their own thing.`,

Victorian-style 100+ year old house on Frenchmen Street -- home of the best collection of jazz clubs in New Orleans -- and still only blocks from the French Quarter. The house retains the architectural details that make New Orleans homes interesting and beautiful -- 13 ft. ceilings, transom windows, original wood floors, and double parlor with functioning pocket doors. Very few renovations have altered this original home, and its charm represents the homes of its era. Great backyard for entertaining -- very private courtyard setting. Smoking is allowed in the backyard. PARKING: Easy on street parking, no meters, no time restrictions and always spaces available on`,

We've travelled to over 40 countries and look forward to returning the hospitality that has been shown to us over the years around the world. We love hiking, biking, travel, and cooking. Yesica is originally from Venezuela and I am a Bostonian but San Francisco is where we both stopped on life's journey.

    description: `We look forward to sharing one of the most vibrant neighborhoods in the city with you, the Mission! PLEASE NOTE: We provide parking but we ask $20 per day, not included in your booking price. It is payable in cash when you arrive. There is only one spot and we have two rooms so please inquire about availability. If you are 2 people and you would like us to set up 2 beds, we ask 15 dollars extra per night to set it up for you. We live in a 3 bedroom, 2 bath flat and list 2 rooms on Airbnb. The two guests rooms share one bathroom. You will either share the bathroom with one other guest or have it to yourself if the other room is not booked. We are near the Valencia Street corridor and we are a 5 minute walk to foodie heaven (Delfina, Bi-RIte, Arizmendi, Dosa, Tartine, etc) . . A very short BART ride gets you to other great parts of the city (door to door 10-20 minutes) including the Moscone Center, Union Square, the Embarcadero, Chinatown, North Beach and we are walking distance`,

We are always up to some new outdoor project when the Colorado weather permits and hunker down inside by the fire in the winter keeping our hands busy with knitting, card making or some other project we can dream up. Giovanni and I have grown in our collaborations and embrace our age and abilities for self governance in employment - Giovanni had moved into documentaries and I have been spending more time in the commercial film community. We have been in the lower highlands for over a decade now and have marveled in the changing landscape and exciting times for new restaurants, breweries and galleries. We still love to take advantage of the great walks thru the neighborhood and down by the river as often as we can.`,

    host_about: `Hi Airbnb-ers, Welcome on my profile page, I am an easy going guy living in downtown Amsterdam. In the middle of it all, yet in in a quiet street. I love to travel and like to meet new people from all over the world! Airbnb is a great community and I am extremely proud they awarded me with the superhost status. I will do the utmost to make you feel comfortable. Besides giving massage I like food, dance, food, theatre, food, coffee, did I say food? ;-) I have 2 B&B rooms and you'll share the bathroom with the other room. I would love to have you as my guest! So if you would like to stay city centre in a quiet room and have delicious breakfast (included) around the corner, come stay! The B&B is situated in the same building as Massage parlor RUST. (yes I also run a massage center, and yes you get a discount!) In the very heart of Amsterdam. Before you book: I welcome you personally and you will receive my house key. Check in is from 14:00-19:00. Luggage drop off before is possible, please make an appointment. I have a surcharge for check in after 19:00. I cannot accept a 3rd person in the room by Amsterdam city law. A baby counts as a person as well. I have an official B&B so no need to worry you stay somewhere illegal as the press is lately not so kind to Airbnb.`,

    description: `Our apartment is perfect for the budget traveler. It's very clean and with about 500 square feet it is spacious enough for 2 guests, although there is a fold out couch if you need it. My wife and I lived here before buying the main house on the property. It was a great place to live and gave us many happy years. I'm sure you will love it too! Located near Congress and Riverside, just a few blocks away from longtime Austin establishments such as Guero's Taco Bar, The Continental Club, Allen's Boots, and many other amazing restaurants, shops and music venues. The South Congress bridge, where the bats emerge at sunset every evening from March to October, is just a few more blocks away and leads directly into the downtown area only a mile from our apartment, all within walking distance. You can pick up the hike and bike trail at the bridge as well, and it runs for many miles around Lady Bird Lake. Public bike rentals are within a five minute walk on Congress Avenue.

    transit: `You can get to Edinburgh by plane,train,car. It's a city made for walking, but if you want there is a very good public travel system. Buses cost £1.60 per journey of £4.00 for day ticket. Taxis are easy to wave down and book, they are expensive for short journeys but very practical if you need to get across town in a hurry. If you bring a car (which I'd advise strongly against if you can help it!) these are the options... Parking in the Old Town of Edinburgh is problematic, as there is no direct free parking as its so small and historic. What spaces you'd find are for residents or pay by the hour spaces. There is no parking on the royal mile/near the castle or anywhere very close to my apartment. However there is parking on Chambers Street and Johnstone Terrrace which is a short walk from James Court. But you can only park there for a maximum of four hours and it's currently £2.60 an hour. It is however free to park there between 6.30pm and 8.30am every day and on Sunday it's free all`,

We're right across the creek from the famous Ballona Creek Bike Path and it's an easy, fun ride to the beaches at Playa del Rey, Venice, Marina del Rey and Santa Monica and we have 2 beach cruiser bikes to loan (you'll need to provide your own safety gear (so please bring it with you) and sign a release before you take the bikes out). We're minutes by foot (25 minutes) , bike (8 minutes) or car (5 minutes) to Playa Vista (Silicon Beach) featuring top companies such as "Bookface," "Yah double o," Microsoft, "G double o gle," Electronic Arts, You Tube, Deutsch, MTV, Core Digital Media, CybeCoders, ICANN, Fox Sports, Social Annex, Rubicon Project, Rovi, Belkin, XPRIZE, 72an`,

    access: `Our house is your house! You’re free to hang out by the fire bowl and swap stories, pick some tiny heirloom strawberries in our front yard organic urban farm or just do your morning emails or read the LA Times in the backyard with the tinkle of our pond in the background. You're also welcome to cook meals yourselves if you like, as we have a pretty large kitchen--sometimes we cook with guests and eat together family style--but whatever works for you. We even have a second BBQ for our non-vegan guests. And don't worry: we're non-judgy, non-preachy vegans, and if it's cocktail night and you're around we'd love you to join us. Not in the mood to cook? Want to stay in for dinner? Let us take care of everything and have family dinner and drinks with us and experience Johnny's amazing vegan cuisine (if our schedule allows). To cover our costs we ask per person $20 for dinner only and $25 for dinner and cocktails/wine.`,

    transit: `We're in a safe, upscale residential neighborhood, so you'll have the most fun if you drive and have a car and have a GPS. Of course you can walk to the bus and we can occasionally drop people somewhere if we have time, but seriously: it's LA and public transport really sucks. RENT A CAR and have a GPS. We have parking in our driveway if your car doesn't leak oil (if it does you'll need to park around the corner as there is no street parking on our street overnight). Using our bikes is a great way to get around and the Ballona Creek Bike Trail will take you to the beaches without exposing you to much car traffic, but bear in mind they do need to be shared with the other guests and the bikes need to be back before it gets dark. Guests that don’t drive get around very well with the peer-to-peer ride sharing apps Lyft and Uber and it often can be similar in cost to renting a car, but car rental is always best. Hey it’s L.A. and the car is king!`,

    host_about: `We're Johnny and Mark, a super-fun, committed (25 years and counting) and married gay couple in our 50s. We live on Ballona Creek in Del Rey, 3.5 miles from the gorgeous Pacific Ocean. We share our beautifully and recently renovated home with our hilarious and well-behaved dogs Wolfgang and Hedwig (we hope you love dogs) and you're welcome to join us on one of our daily local hikes. We're right on the famous Ballona Creek Bike Path; you can grab one of our beach cruiser bikes and head out to the beach at Playa Del Rey or to the Marina, Venice, Santa Monica and Manhattan Beach. We have 2 beautiful guest rooms, one with a queen-sized bed, the other with a double bed. We can sleep 4 comfortably and if you're more we can figure something out. Both rooms share a private bath and have premium streaming cable TV with HBO, Showtime, Epix, Cinemax, Netflix, Amazon and super-fast wifi. We're a non-smoking vegan household, but smoking is OK outside and non-vegan food items are OK too. We may be vegan but don't worry: we're tolerant, non-judgy and non-preachy vegans. Explore Los Angeles (you'll always do best if you rent a car and have GPS capability) and let us insiders point you toward some of our favorite places such as Marilyn Monroe's crypt, the best views of the Hollywood sign, the stores where the studios sell their wardrobe collections, plus other places only real Angelinos know. We love our city and want you to live with us as a local, and that means if you're around there'll be drinkies on cocktail nights (Mark makes a mean vodka martini!). Of course, breakfast is always included. Our home is your home. Johnny parle un excellent français y habla OK español (para un chico blanco). Mark taler perfkt dansk, og OK norsk. Wir sprechen OK Deutsche.`,

    host_about: `I know your not coming to Nashville to visit me, but i will do my best to provide a great place to stay while you are in Nashville! I am a single Dad with 2 great kids off to college! I built this home 3 years ago and love living near downtown Nashville. I am an avid walker and most weeks put in 15 to 20 miles just walking from my home to the Historical Germantown area, Bicentennial Mall State Park, Farmers Market, State Capital, Legislative Plaza, TPAC, then on to Lower Broad, 2nd Ave, and Riverfront park where all the honky tonks are located! That total distance is just a little over 2 miles each way. I was in the USAF and Tennessee Air Guard for 13 years where i was a navigator on C-130's. After my military life i became a General Contractor and started my own business. After being in the country for so long i decided to try the city life. I bought a vacant lot in this historical overlay district and loved it. Since then I have built 2 more homes on this street. I do love this up and coming neighborhood. I also love to hike the mountains! I have summed 3 12,000 foot peaks in the Rockies and last summer my son and I summed 14,254 foot Long's Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park. I must admit - it kicked my ass ... but wow!... what a view! Leaves no doubt there is a God! I also love to kayak and travel. But the best times are with the kids. We love to play strategy board games..Settlers of Catan, Acquire, and Cashflow. I love Axis and Allies, but its hard to get them to play that! I also play in a Texas holdem Poker League...for points...not for cash! UPDATE: That's my first grandbaby...Walt....Born 19 November 2012!!`,

    neighborhood_overview: `When it comes to delicious local eateries, independent retailers, and eclectic shops, far and few areas in Vancouver can compete with Main Street (Mount Pleasant). With coffee houses like Forty Ninth Parallel (and their oh-so-tasty Lucky's Doughnuts), artist-owned Red Cat Records and micro-breweries springing to life, it's no surprise why locals have voted Main Street as Vancouver's “coolest street". It has a vibe that is often compared to Capitol Hill in Seattle, Portland, and Williamsburg in New York. Centrally located, right in the middle of Vancouver where you're not too far west and not too far east! Steps to everything including Vancouver's best coffee within two blocks. An abundance of restaurants and neighborhood bars. Several grocers (organic, asian, large supermarket) and a liquor store at your doorstep with a fine selection of craft beers and wine. Yoga studio just around the corner. A community center with gym and library.`,

I can't live without the ocean and the mountains each an hour and a half drive from here. I love the beautiful Columbia Gorge (1/2 hour) and hiking in Forest Park (minutes away).

Kitchen is available for breakfast and we supply bagels, coffee, tea, and milk. We limit our kitchen to just breakfast for guests other than breakfast you should plan on eating out. Full Bed for two. OK it finally came to this. I have converted my Man Cave to the private and comfy spot just for you. This is a tiny room but hey it's got a 40" flat screen. This room is perfect for the budget traveler who only needs that one night in Denver before heading out of town. The Man Cave is off our back deck, is well insulated and has great dark curtains so the Colorado sunshine won't wake you. The half bath is located inside another door but here is the catch--You have to step outside for about 4 feet`,

Here's a little about me: 1) I have an amazing partner, Meredith, and an ever fluctuating number of kids living with us. 2) The reason why the number of kids changes is because we are foster parents. 3) Being a foster mom is the hardest and most rewarding thing I have ever done. 4) I began hosting on airbnb as a way to supplement our income and allow me to stay home with our kiddos. 5) I'm so glad I did, because I LOVE being an airbnb host! 6) When I have some free time, I love to garden or putter around outside doing projects. 7) I love animals but never expected to have quite so many. 8) I also never expected to be washing so much laundry as an adult. :) 9) I make really good English Toffee. 10) I always share some of my toffee with guests. :)`,
